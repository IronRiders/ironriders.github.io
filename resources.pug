            p Our leadership and coaches are always willing to answer any questions you have. These listed e-mails will connect you to the various leads and coaches our team has. Each lead works on different parts of the club so to get a quicker and/or more accurate response, have an idea of which lead will be appropriate for your question. If you're unsure e-mail either the Team Captain or Communications/VP.
